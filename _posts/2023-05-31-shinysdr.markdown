This post describes how I installed [ShinySDR][shinysdr] on a Raspberry Pi.

I had a RTL-SDR USB receiver ([Nooelec][nooelec]) laying around and wanted to use it headless on a Raspberry Pi and use it via a web interface on my iPad. After searching for a while I tried ShinySDR.

Following the [installation instructions][install-shinysdr] I did these steps:

## Dependencies

Install required and most of the optional packages: `sudo apt install gnuradio gr-osmosdr gr-air-modes multimon-ng rtl-433 wsjtx`

Install some more dependencies: `sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev libatlas-base-dev libjasper-dev`

Use latest version of Python package attrs: `pip install --upgrade attrs`



## Making source code Python 3.9 compatible

ShinySDR is currently only supporting Python 2.7 and I didn't want to install old Python, so I used the branch `python3` from **w1xm's** fork:

`git clone -b python3 https://github.com/w1xm/shinysdr/`

### Patching for Python 3.9

I needed to fix an import and a changed method name for Python 3.9 in `shinysdr/filters.py` and `shinysdr/types.py`, respectively:









Please see my [pull request][w1xm-pr].

## Installing

```bash
cd shinysdr
python3 setup.py build
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
**This needs to be done after installing:**

Latest pip release of txWS 0.9.1 has a bug under Python 3.9, so I installed it directly from Github `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/MostAwesomeDude/txWS#egg=txWS`
## Configuration

Create configs: `shinysdr --create ./shinysdr-config`

I needed to change the ports, because the default ports were used on my system

TODO config, start etc.
