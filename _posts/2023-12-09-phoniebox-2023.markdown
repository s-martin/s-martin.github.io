I built a [Phoniebox][phoniebox] for my kids, please see my [first blog post][first-post] for details. Overall the box worked very good. But sometimes the box would restart out of the blue (sometimes multiple times in a row).

So I decided to rebuilt the Phoniebox with the new-and-shiny version [**3.x** with branch *future3/develop*][future3] and some new hardware parts.

## What I wanted

For my kids I wanted to use RFID cards. In addition the box should have buttons for `Play/Pause`, `FF`, `Rwd`, `Volume up` and `Volume down`.

I wanted the box portable, so I needed a power bank.

My friend has built a excellent custom-made case which fulfills my needs.

That [blog post][blog-instructions] (in German) provided lots of information and I used especially the On/Off description. Thanks for providing that info!

## Hardware

For hardware I decided to use the following or reused it from my first Phoniebox:

* Raspberry Pi 3 (doesn't need an active cooling)
* [GPIO Expansion Board][gpioexp]
* Amplifier [Hifiberry Miniamp][miniamp]
* Ravpower ??? Powerbank
* Neuftech RFID reader
* [OnOffShim][onoffshim]
* Arcade buttons
* Power button
* ...

## Building

### Wiring and Hardware Installation

I connected and soldered everything first, before I assembled the complete box to make sure everything works.

Excellent resource for the pinning is [pinout.xyz][pinout].

#### Overview Wiring

![wiring](/assets/images/wiring.jpg)

#### Buttons

* Prev: pin 39 (Gnd), pin 16 (GPIO23)
* Next: pin 25 (Gnd), pin 18 (GPIO24)
* Play: pin 20 (Gnd), pin 22 (GPIO25)
* Vol-: pin 29 (GPIO5), pin 30 (Gnd)
* Vol+: pin 31 (GPIO6), pin 34 (Gnd)
  
#### Miniamp

* Connect the Miniamp to pin 1 (3V), pin 4 (5V), pin 14 (GND), pin 12 (GPIO18), pin 35 (GPIO19), pin 36 (GPIO16), pin 37 (GPIO26), pin 38 (GPIO20) and pin 40 (GPIO21).
* Connect the speakers to the Miniamp (`L-+ R+-`), see also the [datasheet][datasheet-miniamp].

    ![Miniamp](/assets/images/miniamp.jpg)

#### OnOffShim & Power Button

* [Pinout OnOffShim][pinoutonoff]
* Connect the OnOffShim to pin 2 (5V Pwr), pin 6 (Gnd), pin 7 (GPIO4), pin 11 (GPIO 17)
* Connect Btn1 of OnOffShim to NO (Normal Open) of Power Button, Btn2 to C (Common) and pin 15 (GPIO22) to `+` as well as pin 9 (Gnd) to `-`

### Installation

* Follow the [installation instructions for future3][installation] with the following changes:
  * Use **Bullseye Lite 32 bit** image as the Bookworm Lite image from [December 2023 does not activate WiFi correctly][bug-in-bookworm-lite]
  * And I use the `future3/develop` branch
* I use the following settings
  * Don't use IPv6, Bluetooth, Kiosk mode, Autohotspot
  * As I don't use the Release branch I need to [build the web app locally][build-webapp]
  * I connected my USB reader before the installation and selected it during install
* Configuring Miniamp according to [instructions][miniamp-config]: enable Miniamp in `/boot/config.txt` with

    ```bash
    dtparam=audio=off
    dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac
    dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d,noaudio
    ```

* Reboot
* Follow the [audio configuration instructions and checks][audio-instructions]
* Install [OnOffShim][onoffshim] software
  * Use this one line command: `curl https://get.pimoroni.com/onoffshim | bash`
  * Set `daemon_active=1`, `led_pin=22` and `hold_time=1` in file `/etc/cleanshutd.conf`
  * TODO weg: sudo apt-get install libczmq-dev
  * TODO weg: in src/cli_client: gcc pbc.c -o pbc -lzmq -Wall
  * Make sure the original Phoniebox shutdown script is used: Open `sudo nano /usr/bin/cleanshutd` and replace `shutdown -h +$shutdown_delay` with `source ~/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/.venv/bin/activate; ~/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/src/jukebox/run_rpc_tool.py -c host.shutdown; deactivate`. Be aware that `shutdown_delay` has no effect anymore.

# Software configuration #

My Phoniebox is already installed, so I describe only the necessary changes here. For installation see my [first post][first-post].


scripts/gpio_buttons.py folgendes
 austauschen
 _ siehe datein


dann so wie hier http://splittscheid.de/selfmade-phoniebox/#miniampsetup



## Software installation ##

Software installation first, so everything can be tested.

1. Download latest [Raspian Lite image][raspian-image]
2. [Install][install-rpi] Raspberry Pi with [BalenaEtcher][balenaetcher]
3. Preconfigure WiFI in image, see [here][preconfigure-wifi]
4. Rename to *phoniebox* with `sudo nano /etc/hostname`
5. Login with ssh (default user name: `pi`, default password: `raspberry`)
6. Install Phoniebox software (for Raspian Buster)

*    1. Use this one line command: `cd; rm buster-install-*; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/master/scripts/installscripts/buster-install-default.sh; chmod +x buster-install-default.sh; ./buster-install-default.sh`

    2. See also [here for details][install-phoniebox].

    3. I use the *Classic* version as I don't use Spotify and it's supposed to be faster.

7. I configured the sound according to this [description][fix-sound].
8. To use the buttons I configured the GPIO settings according to [this manual][gpio-config], but without the shutdown, because I use the OnOffShim (see later steps). In the file `scripts/gpio-buttons.py` the pins can be configured and (de)activated. I don‘t use recording although the case and the hardware supports it.
9. Install [OnOffShim][onoffshim] software

    1. Use this one line command: `curl https://get.pimoroni.com/onoffshim | bash`

    2. Set `daemon_active=1`, `led_pin=25` and `hold_time=1` in file `/etc/cleanshutd.conf`

    3. Make sure the original Phoniebox shutdown script is used: Open `sudo nano /usr/bin/cleanshutd` and replace `shutdown -h +$shutdown_delay` with `/home/pi/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/scripts/playout_controls.sh -c=shutdown`. Be aware that `shutdown_delay` has no effect anymore.

10. Reboot with `sudo reboot`.

# Gotchas, lessons learned, etc. #

* It’s really important to solder as good as possible (I’m not very good though). If you have cold solder joints it may or may not work, which can be really annoying.
* Connecting everything together first to test it is really helpful, because you don’t want to assemble everything together in a (tiny) case and then something doesn’t work. 
* It really helps to sketch the wiring on a piece of paper, so you can fix possible issues or misconnections much faster.
