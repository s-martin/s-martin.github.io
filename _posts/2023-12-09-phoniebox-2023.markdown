I built a [Phoniebox][phoniebox] for my kids, please see my [first blog post][first-post] for details. Overall the box worked very good. But sometimes the box would restart out of the blue (sometimes multiple times in a row).

So I decided to rebuilt the Phoniebox with the new-and-shiny version [**3.x** with branch *future3/develop*][future3] and some new hardware parts.

## What I Wanted

For my kids I wanted to use RFID cards. In addition the box should have buttons for `Play/Pause`, `Next`, `Previous`, `Volume up` and `Volume down`.

I wanted the box portable, so I needed a power bank.

My friend has built a excellent custom-made wooden case which helped to fulfill my needs.

That [blog post][blog-instructions] (in German) provided lots of information and I used especially the On/Off description.

> [!WARNING]
> The info in the mentioned blog post is somewhat dated, so you might need to adjust some things.

## Hardware

For hardware I decided to use the following or reused it from my first Phoniebox:

* Raspberry Pi 3 (doesn't need an active cooling)
* [GPIO Expansion Board][gpioexp]
* Amplifier [Hifiberry Miniamp][miniamp]
* Ravpower Powerbank
* Neuftech RFID reader
* [OnOffShim][onoffshim]
* Arcade buttons
* Power button
* ...

## Building

### Wiring and Hardware Installation

I connected and soldered everything first, before I assembled the complete box to make sure everything works.

Excellent resource for the pinning is [pinout.xyz][pinout].

#### Overview Wiring

![wiring](/assets/images/wiring.jpg)

#### Buttons

* Prev: pin 39 (GND), pin 16 (GPIO23)
* Next: pin 25 (GND), pin 18 (GPIO24)
* Play: pin 20 (GND), pin 22 (GPIO25)
* Vol-: pin 29 (GPIO5), pin 30 (GND)
* Vol+: pin 31 (GPIO6), pin 34 (GND)
  
#### Miniamp

* Connect the Miniamp to Raspberry Pi
  * pin 1 (3V)
  * pin 4 (5V)
  * pin 14 (GND)
  * pin 12 (GPIO18)
  * pin 35 (GPIO19)
  * pin 36 (GPIO16)
  * pin 37 (GPIO26)
  * pin 38 (GPIO20)
  * pin 40 (GPIO21)
* Connect the speakers to the Miniamp (`-L+` and `+R-`), see also the [datasheet][datasheet-miniamp].

#### OnOffShim & Power Button

* [Pinout OnOffShim][pinoutonoff]
* Connect the OnOffShim to Raspberry Pi
  * pin 2 (5V Power)
  * pin 6 (GND)
  * pin 7 (GPIO4)
  * pin 11 (GPIO 17)
* Connect Btn1 of OnOffShim to NO (Normal Open) of Power Button
* Connect Btn2 of OnOffShim to C (Common) of Power Button
* Connect pin 15 (GPIO22) of Raspberry Pi to `+` of Power Button
* Connect pin 9 (GND) of Raspberry Pi to `-` of Power Button (?? currently works only with - connected to GPIO7 / pin 26??)

### Installation

* Follow the [installation instructions for future3][installation] with the following changes:
  > [!WARNING]
  > Use **Bullseye Lite 32 bit** image!
  > Bookworm or 64 bit do not work with Phoniebox (yet).
  
  And I use the `future3/develop` branch
* I use the following settings
  * Don't use IPv6, Bluetooth, Kiosk mode, Autohotspot
  * As I don't use the Release branch I need to [build the web app locally][build-webapp]. IMPORTANT: install node first (see link)!
  * I connected my USB reader before the installation and selected it during install
* **Reboot**
* Install Hifiberry Miniamp using the [provided script][miniamp-install-script]
* ?? Follow the [audio configuration instructions and checks][audio-instructions]
* Install [OnOffShim][onoffshim] software
  * Use this one line command: `curl https://get.pimoroni.com/onoffshim | bash`
  * ?? Set `daemon_active=1`, `led_pin=22` and `hold_time=1` in file `/etc/cleanshutd.conf`
  * TODO weg: sudo apt-get install libczmq-dev
  * TODO weg: in src/cli_client: gcc pbc.c -o pbc -lzmq -Wall
  * ?? Make sure the original Phoniebox shutdown script is used: Open `sudo nano /usr/bin/cleanshutd` and replace `shutdown -h +$shutdown_delay` with `source ~/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/.venv/bin/activate; ~/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/src/jukebox/run_rpc_tool.py -c host.shutdown; deactivate`. Be aware that `shutdown_delay` has no effect anymore.

## Software configuration & installation

dann so wie hier <http://splittscheid.de/selfmade-phoniebox/#miniampsetup>

Software installation first, so everything can be tested.

1. I configured the sound according to this [description][fix-sound].
1. To use the buttons I configured the GPIO settings according to [this manual][gpio-config], but without the shutdown, because I use the OnOffShim (see later steps). In the file `scripts/gpio-buttons.py` the pins can be configured and (de)activated. I don‘t use recording although the case and the hardware supports it.

## Gotchas, Lessons learned

* It’s really important to solder as good as possible (I’m not very good though). If you have cold solder joints it may or may not work, which can be really annoying.
* Connecting everything together first to test it is really helpful, because you don’t want to assemble everything together in a (tiny) case and then something doesn’t work.
* It really helps to sketch the wiring on a piece of paper, so you can fix possible issues or misconnections much faster.
